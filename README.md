Just pull the script and add execution rights to it (chmod +x decrypt-cc.sh). Then execute the script (bash decrypt-cc.sh or ./decrypt-cc.sh (if you are already in the same path of the script)).<br>
To execute the script, provide the chain to decrypt to the script as a parameter, e.g.: 

$ bash decrypt-cc.sh "LZW IMAUC TJGOF XGP BMEHK GNWJ LZW DSRQ VGY GX USWKSJ"

Paste the text inside quotes (if it has blanks), "..." as in the example of above.<br>
The script will return your chain but applying ROT from 1-26, and you need to find the correct sentence in the output.
